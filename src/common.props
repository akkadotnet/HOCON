    <PackageReleaseNotes>HOCON 1.0.0 is a complete and total rewrite of the HOCON parsing engine, designed to work with both the .NET Framework (4.5 and later) and .NET Standard 1.3.
The performance has significantly improved, as have the range of features supported by this library, including:
Built-in enviroment variable substitution;
[Support for better byte and time formats](https://github.com/akkadotnet/akka.net/pull/3600);
[Improved object substitution and merging](https://github.com/akkadotnet/HOCON/pull/55);
and many more features.
This library will be developed and released independently from Akka.NET itself, but beginning with Akka.NET v1.4 it will be taken as a dependency by the core Akka libraries.
HOCON ships as two NuGet packages:
`HOCON` - includes all core parser, substitution, tokenization, and other functionality;
`HOCON.Configuration` - adds `App.config` and `System.Configuration` integration to HOCON.</PackageReleaseNotes>
